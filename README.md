# Usher
Usher is a "smarthome"/"IoT"/internet of shit platform for making smart devices talk to each other, and do cool things.
It relies less on complicated configuration files and DSLs, and just assumes that if you're the sort of person who
intentionally bought more than one IoT device, you can probably write C# code.

You should be able to compile it on Linux with [some hacks](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/3703).

Currently in-progress, but this documentation will be updated once all intended v1 features are working. In the
meantime see the Plugins/ folder for usage.
